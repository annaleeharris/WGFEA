WGBasis:
  The side bases are wrong, the elements are linearly dependent.
  Use a subset of the same monomials, but we don't need all of them.  For rectangular meshes, we don't need monomials where
  the axis dimension factor has nonzero exponent.
  More generally, a mesh should be able to answer for each side which dimension is dependent on the others on the side.
  For each side, there is a coordinate j for which c_i exist with x_j = c_0 + sum_i c_i x_i for all x=(x_1,...,x_d) in the
  side [call this "affine-dependent"?]. There may be more than one such coordinate number, the mesh just returns any one.
  The basis will need to be modified to keep a reference list of monomials for each reference side, after asking the mesh.
