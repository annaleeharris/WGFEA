Q: Are side basis elements well defined?  We are using local monomials defined by the fe's coordinate system,
   but the side has two such fe's, leading to contradictory definitions.
   For rectanglar meshes, the definitions aren't really contradictory, because the dimension that would differ is
   not a factor in the monomial (the dependent dimension).

   Maybe this is a non issue. But check all uses of side monomials in actual computations.  Make sure the side
   monomials are always interpreted in a way that's independent of the side's embedding in any finite elment.
   Consider e.g. a side like \ on a hexagon.

  For d=2,3 add numerical prod integral implementations and tests.

Long Term
---------
Allow multiple reference elements, e.g. for triangular meshes, which have alternating triangle orientations.
Most methods that just take a face would have to take a reference element code and a face, or a fe num and a face.

Documentation Changes
---------------------
rmesh docs:
  New interface functions:
    integral_prod_on_ref_fe_side_vs_outward_normal
    integral_vs_local_monomial_on_fe_interior
    integral_on_ref_fe_face
    num_side_faces_per_fe
    space_dim
    is_boundary_side
    side_face
    dependent_axis_for_side_face
  Change description of basis ordering, now pure lexicographically ordered.
  Change description of side basis size, and describe interaction with mesh to find "dependent dimension" for a side to form the basis there.
