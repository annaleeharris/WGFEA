Commit Notes
------------
Mesh:
  Add generic interface functions
    - integral_prod_on_ref_fe_side_vs_outward_normal, to allow integrating polynomial * monomial vector against an outward normal on a face, and to allow mesh implementations to specialize products against outward normals on faces efficently (avoid allocation if trivially zero).
    - function num_side_faces_per_fe: to allow clients to enumerate sides, e.g. to precompute integrals over faces
    - space_dim
  Renamed Face to FEFace for clarity and introduced constructor function fe_face.

WGBasis
  - Add interior/side_monomial_num and accessors interior/side_monomial_by_num to allow clients to create caches of computations by monomial number.
  - Add functions num_interior/side_monomials_per_fe
WGMethod
  - Created WGSolver type to hold precomputed values not depending on rhs function f in the variational problem or boundary value function g.
  - Created basis tests file.

Notes
-----
Add to rmesh docs:
  New interface functions:
    integral_prod_on_ref_fe_side_vs_outward_normal
    num_side_faces_per_fe
    space_dim

TODO
----
(WGRAD)
  - Compute weak gradient of polynomial Q_b g on each finite element intersecting the outside boundary.
  - Compute parts of a_s(p, b_i)_T for a polynomial p on an outside boundary segment.

(Mesh)
 - Determine whether a given fe includes a segment of the outside boundary.
   for: a_s(Q_b g, b_i)

 - Project an arbitrary function g onto space of polynomials of a given degree on a face of a fe
   (can't do this on ref element, need actual fe coords)
   for: Q_b g

 - Integrate an arbitrary function f against a basis element on a mesh element.
   for: (f, (b_i)_0)
