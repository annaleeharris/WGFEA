Commit Notes
------------
VBF: Add cache argument to *_vs_* computation functions, add missing basis argument to side vs side calls.

TODO
----
Implement cacheing of projections in VBF_a_s.  Just lookup the cache by dictionary with mesh as key.


Concatenate two rectangular meshes left/right or upper/lower?
  Only fes on the joined boundary will need to have new computations.

Q: Look into caching projections where they may be multiply computed.

Support multiple reference elements.
  Every mesh function that takes a face but does not take a finite element number, should take a reference element number.
  The reference element is a function of the finite element number.


Documentation Changes
---------------------
rmesh docs:
  New interface functions:
    integral_prod_on_ref_fe_side_vs_outward_normal
    integral_vs_local_monomial_on_fe_interior
    integral_on_ref_fe_face
    num_side_faces_per_fe
    space_dim
    is_boundary_side
    side_face
    dependent_axis_for_side_face
    fe_diameter
    one_mon
  Change description of basis ordering, now pure lexicographically ordered.
  Change description of side basis size, and describe interaction with mesh to find "dependent dimension" for a side to form the basis there.
