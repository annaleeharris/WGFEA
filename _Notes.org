Fix tau > 0.
Generate rectangle mesh of diagonal (el diam) tau.
  Add function in RMesh to output in Gmsh format.
    Write out point and rectangle basic elements (see Gmsh tutorial).
    Assign element numbers as physical regions.
  Make script invoking Gmsh to triangulate this generated rectangular mesh with a target triangle diameter of tau^(1/alpha).
  Modify Tmsh to read and store physical region per element, and add accessor to interface.

Method:
  Construct tau mesh.  
  Run script to generate triangular mesh.
  Construct triangular mesh from generated file.
  Build a map of rectangle to set of triangle element numbers included in the rectangle.
  For each rectangle T_tau in tau mesh,
    Obtain triangle element numbers T_hi comprising rectangle T_tau.
    Let u_hi be the WGSol polynomial for T_hi.
    Solve the linear system with RHS having i^th component
      (u_h, m_i) = sum_i { (u_hi, m_i)_{T_hi} } = sum_i { int_{T_hi} u_hi m_i }
    where m_i is the i^th basis polynomial for the V_tau polynomial space.
