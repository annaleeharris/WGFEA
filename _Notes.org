TODO
----
Finish impl (fix) of WGBasis.solution_wgrad_for_fe.
  Retest weak hradient calculations around the boundaries.

Add proper total errors, for L2 and triple bar norm (add latter to general VBF interface).
  Pass precomputed boundary projections from the solution structure.

Specialize constant projection for efficiency.

Try using a sparse matrix for vbf basis vs basis matrix.

  "In julia, you are using \ to solve the system. This currently defaults to using LU factorization.
   However, if your system is SPD, there are gains from using a cholesky solver. Matlab does this
   automatically, and Julia does this automatically in the dense case, but not yet in the sparse case."

Implement classical WG, which is just A_s without the stabilization term.


Concatenate two rectangular meshes left/right or upper/lower?
  Only fes on the joined boundary will need to have new computations.

Q: Look into caching projections where they may be multiply computed.

Support multiple reference elements.
  Every mesh function that takes a face but does not take a finite element number, should take a reference element number.
  The reference element is a function of the finite element number.


Documentation Changes
---------------------
rmesh docs:
  New interface functions:
    integral_prod_on_ref_fe_side_vs_outward_normal
    integral_vs_local_monomial_on_fe_interior
    integral_on_ref_fe_face
    num_side_faces_per_fe
    space_dim
    is_boundary_side
    side_face
    dependent_axis_for_side_face
    fe_diameter
    one_mon
  Change description of basis ordering, now pure lexicographically ordered.
  Change description of side basis size, and describe interaction with mesh to find "dependent dimension" for a side to form the basis there.
