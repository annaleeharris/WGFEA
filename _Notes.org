Review VBF, VBF_a_s, WG

Q: Look into caching projections where they may be multiply computed.

Support multiple reference elements.
  Every mesh function that takes a face but does not take a finite element number, should take a reference element number.
  The reference element is a function of the finite element number.


Integration Calls and Expected Coordinate Systems
-------------------------------------------------
Proj
  OK
VBF
  There are no Mesh.integral* calls in this module, but every x_mon_vs_y_mon call uses monomials expecting face-local coordinates
  since they represent basis elements on the faces.
  The poly_on_boundary_side_face_vs_bel function expects the polynomial to be interpeted side-locally since it results from projection
  onto the side.  This matches the implication of the function name ("poly on boundary side") and the implementation which
  delegates to side_mon_vs_int/side_mon which are documented to interpret monomials face-locally.
VBF_a_s
  All calls to Mesh.integral_on_ref_fe_face and Mesh.integral_prod_on_ref_fe_face expect face-local monomials, matching the
  mesh's documented expectations.

WGrad
  The right term of the RHS needs an integral where the test function vector monomial is interpreted with the *fe interior*
  local origin (not that of the face!), while the other factor (v_b) is interpreted with the face's origin.
  Check other callers of the mesh functions involved, separate into separate functions if necessary, make the semantics clear
  for each.


TODO
----
Allow multiple reference elements, e.g. for triangular meshes, which have alternating triangle orientations.
Most methods that just take a face would have to take a reference element code and a face, or a fe num and a face.


Documentation Changes
---------------------
rmesh docs:
  New interface functions:
    integral_prod_on_ref_fe_side_vs_outward_normal
    integral_vs_local_monomial_on_fe_interior
    integral_on_ref_fe_face
    num_side_faces_per_fe
    space_dim
    is_boundary_side
    side_face
    dependent_axis_for_side_face
    fe_diameter
    one_mon
  Change description of basis ordering, now pure lexicographically ordered.
  Change description of side basis size, and describe interaction with mesh to find "dependent dimension" for a side to form the basis there.
